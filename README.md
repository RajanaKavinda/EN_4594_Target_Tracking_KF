# EN_4594_Target_Tracking_KF
2D Target Tracking Kalman Filter Python Implementation 

Objectives 
 
The primary objectives of this project include: 
1. Designing a Kalman filter to track a target's motion in 2D space. 
2. Implementing the filter in Python to estimate the object's position and velocity. 
3. Evaluating the filter's performance
